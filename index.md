<p>Welcome to Learn German. This website is designed to help you to learn some basic/introductory German. The website covers the following topics: Numbers,Greetings and Food. For each topic there is a page dedicated to teaching the vocabulary related to the topic and one page dedicated to testing what you have learnt through a variety of exercises. Whilst each page has links to all other pages on the website it is <strong> strongly </strong> recommended that you follow the following structure:
  
  First go to the <a href="Numbers.html">Numbers</a> page and then complete the corresponding exercise,that is <a href="NumbersExercise.html">Exercise 1</a>.
  
 Then go to the <a href="GreetingsandGoodbyes.html">Greetings </a> page and view the animation. Once you have done so complete the corresponding exercise,that is <a href="GreetingsExercise.html">Exercise 2</a>.

Once you have done that then go on to the <a href="Food.html">Food</a> page and watch the video. Next complete the corresponding exercise,that is <a href="FoodExercise.html">Exercise 3</a> which aims to test how much vocabulary you have been able to retain. 

Finally, you will find more information on continuing to learn German, should you wish to do so, on the <a href="FurtherInformation.html">Further Information </a> page. </p>
